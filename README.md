Welcome to the Snake Game! This project is a modern take on the classic Snake game, built using Python and Pygame. The game features multiple levels of difficulty, obstacles, and a high score tracking system.

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay
- Multiple difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert
- Randomly generated obstacles
- High score tracking
- Pause and resume functionality
- Fullscreen mode

    cd Snake_Game
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```

## Quick Start
